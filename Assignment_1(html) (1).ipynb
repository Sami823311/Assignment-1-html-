        "Q1 : Explain the main components of client-server architecture and their functions .\n",
        "\n",
        "   Ans : Client-sever architecture is a popular computing model which is used to distribute workloads between service providers(servers) and service requesters(clients). The main components and their functions are :\n",
        "\n",
        "i) **Client** : A client is a device or application (e.g., a web app or a smartphone app ) that initiates a request for service or resources from the server.\n",
        "\n",
        ".Functions :\n",
        "\n",
        ". Sends requests to the server (e.g., retrieving a web page , accessing a database).\n",
        "\n",
        ".Handles user interaction by presenting data and enabling inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        ".Typically lightweight , focusing on user-centric tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "ii) **Server** : A server is a powerful machine or program that provides services or resources in response to client requests.\n",
        "\n",
        ".Functions :\n",
        "\n",
        ". Process client requests and performs the required operation (e.e., data retrieval , file management ).\n",
        "\n",
        ". Maintains and manages resources , such as database , files , or applications.\n",
        "\n",
        ". Sends the requested data or results back to the client.\n",
        "\n",
        "iii) **Network ** : The communication channel that connects clients and servers.\n",
        "\n",
        ".Functions :\n",
        "\n",
        ". Facilitates the exchange of data between the client and server.\n",
        "\n",
        ".Ensure secure and reliable communication through protocols (e.g., HTTP,FTP,TCP,IP).\n",
        "\n",
        "iv) **Application Layer ** : The software or interface that allows clients and servers to interact.\n",
        "\n",
        ".Functions :\n",
        "\n",
        ".Defines the logic for communication and data exchange.\n",
        "\n",
        ".Includes protocols like HTTP(for web applications) or SMTP(for email).\n",
        "\n",
        "v) **Database/Storage** : A storage system, often managed by the server, where data is stored and retrieved.\n",
        "\n",
        ".Functions :\n",
        "\n",
        ". Stores and organizes data efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        ". Handles queries and provides requested data to the client through the server.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2 :  Discuss the various career paths available after completing a web development course\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans : After completing the web developement course we can work as a frontend developer or backend developer or as a full stack web developer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3 : Describe the role of a web browser's developer tools in web development.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans : Web browser developer tools are essential for web development , offering powerful features to analyze, debug, and optimize websites. Popular browser developer tools include Chrome DevTools, Firefox Developer Tools, and Edge DevTools. They serve as a direct line to understanding and refining the inner working of a website.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4 : What are the advantages of using a Version Control System like Git in a development project.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans : Using a Version Control System (VCS) like Git offers numerous advantages for developement projects, enhancing collaboration, productivity, and project management.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example :\n",
        "\n",
        ". Collaboration Made Easy\n",
